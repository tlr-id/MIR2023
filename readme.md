# What is this

Project realised in the context of Music Information Retrieval class of the SMC Master inside the MTG @ UPF - 2022/2023.

The goal is to realise a classification task by implementing several models.

In my case, I'm doing genre classification of electronic music genres using the EDM Beatport Key Dataset (https://zenodo.org/record/1101082).

# Results 

*  SVM : 42% accuracy
*   Sequential model (Neural Network) : 60% accuracy
*   KNN : 68% accuracy but very sensitive to noise and outliers
*   KNN with LDA : Nearly 90% accuracy

Could be improved in many way, but it's a nice introduction to this topic.
